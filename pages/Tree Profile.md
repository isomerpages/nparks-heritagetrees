<p>The seeds from trees of the same species were brought into Singapore from
Darjeeling (India) on 4 May 1925 and they were nurtured in the Singapore
Botanic Gardens nursery for 4 years until the sapling was planted at its
current site on 17 May 1929.</p>
<p>Initially thought to be <em>Albizia lebbekoides</em>, it was not until
February 2016 when the tree was re-identified as <em>Albizia niopoides</em> var. <em>niopoides</em>,
a species native to tropical America. Despite its neotropical origins,
this species has been known to be introduced into cultivation in countries
across the Old World tropics such as Nigeria, Mauritius, and India â€” or
in this case, Darjeeling.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This Heritage Tree has attained a height of 46 metres with a trunk girth
of 6.3m as recorded in 2014.</p>
