<p>Heritage Trees are a special group of mature trees that represent the
natural heritage of Singapore. Serving as important green landmarks of
our City in Nature, these trees help to create a sense of permanence and
identity to the place we call home. It takes decades and, in some cases,
hundreds of years for these trees to mature gracefully and beautify our
landscape.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Heritage Trees are typically more than 5 metres in girth and are noted
for their botanical, historical, social, cultural and/or aesthetic value.</p>
