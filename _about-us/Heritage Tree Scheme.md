<h4><strong>About the Heritage Tree Scheme</strong></h4>
<p>The Heritage Tree Scheme was started on 17 August 2001 by National Parks
Board to identify, recognise and conserve mature trees in our landscape
in view of rising concerns from Singapore's rapid development.</p>
<p>In support of this initiative, a Heritage Trees Fund was established by
The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC), with an initial
donation of $125,000. The Fund is used to implement a conservation programme
to safeguard our Heritage Trees and to promote appreciation of our natural
heritage. Some of these programme initiatives include installation of lightning
conductors, interpretive signages, and putting in place a nomination scheme
for the community.</p>
<p>There are currently 258 Heritage Trees in the Heritage Tree Register,
as of &lt;date&gt;.</p>

of trees in a single avenue endorsed under the NParks' Heritage Tree Scheme.</p>
