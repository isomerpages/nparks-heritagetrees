<h4><strong>About the Scheme</strong></h4>
<p>Announced on 17 August 2001, the Heritage Tree Scheme advocates the conservation
of mature trees in view of rising concerns from Singapore's rapid development.</p>
<p>In support of this initiative, a Heritage Trees Fund was established by
The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC), with an initial
donation of $125,000. The Fund is used to implement a conservation programme
to safeguard our Heritage Trees and to promote appreciation of our natural
heritage. Some of these programme initiatives include installation of lightning
conductors, interpretive signages, and putting in place a nomination scheme
for the community.</p>
<p>There are currently 262 Heritage Trees in the Heritage Tree Register,
as of &lt;date&gt;.</p>

<h4><strong>Did you know?</strong></h4>
<p>In 2016, a total of 20 Rain Trees at Connaught Drive were endorsed as
Heritage Trees. This "Avenue of Heritage Trees" has the largest number
of trees in a single avenue endorsed under the NParks' Heritage Tree Scheme.</p>
