<h3><strong>What are Heritage Trees?</strong></h3>
<p>Heritage Trees are a special group of mature trees that represent the
natural heritage of Singapore. Serving as important green landmarks of
our City in Nature, these trees help to create a sense of permanence and
identity to the place we call home. It takes decades and, in some cases,
hundreds of years for these trees to mature gracefully and beautify our
landscape.</p>
<p>Heritage Trees are typically more than 5 metres in girth and are noted
for their botanical, historical, social, cultural and/or aesthetic value.</p>
<h3><strong>About the Heritage Tree Scheme</strong></h3>
<p>The Heritage Tree Scheme was started on 17 August 2001 by the National
Parks Board to identify, recognise and conserve mature trees in our landscape.
With Singapore's rapid development, it is increasingly important to conserve
our natural heritage.</p>
<p>In support of this initiative, a Heritage Trees Fund was established with
support from The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC),
with a seed donation of $125,000. The Fund was used to initiate the conservation
programme to safeguard Singapore's Heritage Trees and to promote appreciation
of our natural heritage. Some of these programme initiatives include installation
of lightning conductors, interpretive signages, and putting in place a
nomination scheme for the community.</p>

Heritage Trees. This "Avenue of Heritage Trees" has the largest number
of trees in a single avenue endorsed under the NParks' Heritage Tree Scheme.</p>
