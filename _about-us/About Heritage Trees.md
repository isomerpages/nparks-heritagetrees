<h4><strong>What is a Heritage Tree?</strong></h4>
<p>Heritage Trees is a special group of matured trees, noted and conserved
for their botanical, social, historical, aesthetic and/or cultural significance.
Being a part of our local natural heritage and serve as important green
landmarks of our Tropical Garden City, these trees help to create a sense
of permanence and identity to the place we call home. It takes decades
and, in some cases, more than hundreds of years for these trees to mature
gracefully and beautify our landscape.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>About the Scheme</strong></h4>
<p>Announced on 17 August 2001, the Heritage Tree Scheme advocates the conservation
of mature trees in view of rising concerns from Singapore's rapid development.</p>
<p>In support of this initiative, a Heritage Trees Fund was established by
The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC), with an initial
donation of $125,000. The Fund is used to implement a conservation programme
to safeguard our Heritage Trees and to promote appreciation of our natural
heritage. Some of these programme initiatives include installation of lightning
conductors, interpretive signages, and putting in place a nomination scheme
for the community.</p>
<p>There are currently 262 Heritage Trees in the Heritage Tree Register,
as of &lt;date&gt;.</p>
