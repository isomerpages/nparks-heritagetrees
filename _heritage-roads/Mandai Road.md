<p>Take a calm and relaxing drive on Mandai Road, one of Singaporeâ€™s oldest
carriageways. Located along the verdant greenery of Upper Seletar Reservoir,
this shaded boulevard allows you to enjoy a tranquil driving experience.
As you cruise past rows of mature Rain trees with their widespread canopies,
you will also be surrounded by lush vegetation of the secondary forest.</p>
<p>Constructed in 1855, the road served as one of the main links between
Woodlands and Upper Thomson, connecting agriculture and poultry farming
villages such as Bukit Mandai, Sungei Mandai and Nee Soon Village.</p>
