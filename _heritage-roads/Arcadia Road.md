<p>Just a short drive away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre
lies Arcadia Road, a scenic avenue lined with mature Rain trees. Enjoy
a calming drive as you navigate through Arcadia Road’s green tunnel. Slow
down and take in the old civil service residences of Adam Park Estate,
a lasting legacy of Singapore’s colonial past that’s nestled amidst the
lush forests of the nearby MacRitchie Reservoir.</p>
<p>Before the Pan Island Expressway was constructed, Arcadia Road was a gentle
curving track between the neighbouring hills, connecting road users to
the numerous country pathways behind the Eng Neo private estate, in the
direction of the former Turf Club. Today, Arcadia Road offers both residents
and visitors a quiet and peaceful drive under the shady canopy of the majestic
Rain trees.</p>
