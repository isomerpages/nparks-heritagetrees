<p>Built before the 1900s to serve the gambier, pepper and rubber plantations dotting the north-western countryside, Lim Chu Kang road became the main connection between the villages and the city-bound roads of Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Timah as the population grew. The stretches at Ama Keng and Thong Hoe Village were once lined with single and two-storey residences and shop houses. These shops provided for the everyday needs of the rural community. Hence, Lim Chu Kang road provides a glimpse into the past of Singaporeâ€™s growth and history.</p>

<p>From 8 June 2025, a portion of the road will be decommissioned to accommodate the expansion of Tengah Air Base. The remaining 0.6 kilometres continue to be a Heritage Road and greenery will be enhanced with native forest species, such as the <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/flora/2/8/2866">Jelutong (<i>Dyera costulata</i>)</a>, the fruit-bearing <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/flora/2/9/2923">Asam Gelugor (<i>Garcinia atroviridis</i>)</a> and <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/flora/3/0/3084">Island Lychee (<i>Pometia pinnata</i>)</a>, as well as the coastal <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/flora/2/8/2834">Katong Laut (<i>Cynometra ramiflora</i>)</a> and <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/flora/3/3/3392">Seashore Mangosteen (<i>Garcinia celebica</i>)</a>. Alongside the existing mature <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/flora/3/1/3150">Broad-leafed Mahoganies (<i>Swietenia macrophylla</i>)</a>, the improved green buffer will provide shade for road users, greater ecological connectivity for biodiversity in the area and add to the historical charm of this Heritage Road.</p>
