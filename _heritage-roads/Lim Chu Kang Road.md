<p>Go on a journey back in time as you cruise the historical Lim Chu Kang Road. Drive along this tranquil outback as you take in the old kampong ambience and lush greenery of <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/flora/3/0/3093">Angsana (<i>Pterocarpus indicus</i>)</a>, <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/flora/3/1/3150">Broad-Leafed Mahogany (<i>Swietenia macrophylla</i>)</a> and <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/flora/2/9/2953">Para Rubber trees (<i>Hevea brasiliensis</i>)</a>, as well as the thick shrubbery of <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/flora/2/8/2847">Simpoh Ayer (<i>Dillenia suffruticosa</i>)</a> and <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/flora/2/2/2221">Common Sendudok (<i>Melastoma malabathricum</i>)</a>, that line its rural roads.</p>

<p>Built before the 1900s to serve the gambier, pepper and rubber plantations dotting the north-western countryside, the road became the main connection between the villages and the city-bound roads of Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Timah as the population grew. The stretches at Ama Keng and Thong Hoe Village were once lined with single and two-storey residences and shop houses. These shops provided for the everyday needs of the rural community. The old attap and zinc-roofed homes that were scattered along this beautiful road were sheltered by the same mature trees that are still standing today.</p>
