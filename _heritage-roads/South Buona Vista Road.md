<p>Laid through the high ridges of Kent Ridge Park, South Buona Vista Road
is a picturesque boulevard flanked by forest edges of Silver Backs, Acacia,
Tembusu and Tiup Tiup, as well as planted Pelong trees, Kelat Nenasi, Salam
and Yellow Flame trees. The notorious hairpin curves of this dazzling green
tunnel links Dover to Pasir Panjang Road, and require careful navigation.</p>
<p>As its name suggests in Italian, the descending slopes of South Buona
Vista Road used to offer drivers stunning elevated sea views. Constructed
before World War II, the ridges were the site of the famous battle of Pasir
Panjang, which took place in February 1942 between the invading Japanese
forces and the Malay Regiment, led by Lt. Adnan.&nbsp;</p>
