<h4><strong>About the Heritage Tree Scheme</strong></h4>
<p>The Heritage Tree Scheme, announced on 17 August 2001, advocates the conservation
of Singaporeâ€™s mature trees. In support of this initiative, The Hongkong
and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC) helped to fund and kick-start
a conservation programme that safeguards and promotes appreciation of our
natural heritage. The programme now includes initiatives such as the installation
of interpretive signage and the setting up of a nomination scheme for the
community.</p>
<p>In 2016, a total of 20 Rain Trees at Connaught Drive were endorsed as
Heritage Trees. This "Avenue of Heritage Trees" has the largest number
of trees in a single avenue endorsed under the NParks' Heritage Tree Scheme.</p>
<p>There are 260 Heritage Trees in the Heritage Tree Register.</p>
