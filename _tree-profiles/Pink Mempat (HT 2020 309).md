<p>The Pink Mempat is a small to large sized tree that is native to Singapore. It can also be found naturally distributed in Indo-china, Sumatra, West Malaysia and the Philippines. It has an open crown, and can reach a height of 45 metres in its natural habitat such as in primary or secondary forests, along rivers and swamps. However, when grown in Singaporeâ€™s urban parks and gardens, it has been observed to reach about 35 m in height.</p>

<p>It is widely used as a landscape tree in Singapore and it is treasured for its beautiful light pink flowers, which are reminiscent of cherry blossoms. The Pink Mempat blooms seasonally, usually after a prolonged dry spell followed by heavy rain. Around these times, the tree may shed its leaves, replacing its crown with a vivid, pink hued display of faintly fragrant flowers. The flowers are found in clusters of 1 to 6, in the axils of fallen leaves or on bare twigs. In streets lined with Pink Mempat trees, the synchronous flowering produces a beautiful scene akin to spring flowering. The plant is easy to spot when its crown is covered with light pink flowers nestled amidst a flush of reddish young foliage. As leaves mature, they change from red to green in colour.</p>

<p>Apart from its beauty as a landscape tree, the Pink Mempat is also valued for its wood known as derum, which is used for carving, charcoal, firewood, furniture, house construction, poles and turnery.</p>

<p>It is also the preferred local food plant for caterpillars of the Archduke (<a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/1/0/1011"><em>Lexias pardalis dirteana</em></a>). The adult of the Archduke lays its eggs singly on the undersides of leaves and when the caterpillars hatch, they emerge to feed on the leaves of the host plant.</p>

<p>This beautiful Pink Mempat in Nim Crescent Open Space had a girth of 2.51 m when it was endorsed as a Heritage Tree in 2020.</p>
