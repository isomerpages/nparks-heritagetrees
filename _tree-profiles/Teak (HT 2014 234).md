<p>This Heritage Tree at the Singapore Botanic Gardens dates from 1884.</p>

<p>This species originated from Indochina, Malesia, Myanmar, India, Thailand. It was introduced to Singapore. It is a large deciduous tree, reaching up to 40m in height in suitable climates.</p>

<p>The Teak is a tree of the more open, monsoon-forest where a resting season is forced upon it by the dry weather. At such times, the tree is bare of leaves and it flowers and fruits after the new leaves have opened in the ensuring wet season. It appears that a lack of a dry season upset the growth of the Teak by compelling it to vegetate (bear leaves only) almost continuously. Also, the profusion of other trees suited for the rainforests of this region would prevent the Teak from establishing itself in our rainforests.</p>

<p>Teak trees are deciduous after the dry season in monsoon weather. Where there is no marked dry weather, the trees remain evergreen. Teak is known for its high quality timber &amp; used in traditional medicine to reduce swelling. </p>

<p>Teak is a yellowish brown timber with good grain and texture. Teak, though easily worked, can cause severe blunting on edged tools because of the presence of silica in the wood. Teak is often an effective material for the construction of both indoor and outdoor furniture. Teak's high oil content, high tensile strength and tight grain makes it particularly suitable for outdoor furniture applications. Over time teak can mature to a silvery-grey finish, especially when exposed to sunlight. It is used in the manufacture of outdoor furniture, boat decks, and other articles where weather resistance is desired. It is also used for cutting boards, indoor flooring, counter-tops and as a veneer for indoor furnishings. Teak is used extensively in India to make doors and window frames, furniture, and columns and beams in old type houses. It is very resistant to termite attacks. Mature teak fetches a very good price. It is grown extensively by forest departments of different states in forest areas.</p>
