<p>The Inai Inai is an evergreen tree species that can grow as a shrub or a small tree, but is also known to reach a height of 45 m, with a fine-leafed crown. Its trunk is dark brown in colour, and narrowly ridged and fissured, and the leaves are narrowly-elliptic in shape, 4-8 cm long and 1-3 cm wide with a waxy bottom surface. The small flowers are white to yellow in colour, and its fruits are bright red, ellipsoidal in shape, up to 1.5 cm long, pulpy and containing a single stone.</p>
  
<p>In Singapore, this tree is common only in relatively undisturbed coastal areas in St. John's Island and areas around Changi. It has a very appealing shade of green under sunlight. Its fruits are small oval berries that ripen to a brilliant red. Its flowers are small, white and mildly fragrant. This tree is slow growing with dense timber, which have been used for house-posts. The leaves of <em>E. cuneatum</em> are reported to be used as fish poison in the Philippines (Luzon).</p>

<p>This Heritage Tree had a girth of 1.4m when measured in Year 2003.</p>
