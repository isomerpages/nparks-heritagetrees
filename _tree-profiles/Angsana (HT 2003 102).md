<p>The Angsana is a large deciduous tree that grows up to 40m in height. Its crown is dense, dome-shaped, wide-spreading, with drooping, pinnate compound leaves. Its flowers are yellow and occur in large bunches of 15-30 cm long, and the fruits are flattened, disc-like pods with papery wings about 5cm in diameter, 1 or more seeds in each. Cultivated as a street tree here in Singapore, the Angsana is native to India, China throughout Southeast Asia, excluding Singapore.</p>
  
<p>The floral buds of the Angsana develop high up on the crown, unnoticed by anyone, until the right stimulus triggers the buds on the crown to bloom in yellow simultaneously. This brilliant display of colour lasts only for a day, after which the tree lays a soft carpet of yellow flowers on the ground beneath it.</p>
	
<p>This Heritage Tree had a girth of 5.6m when measured in 2003.</p>
