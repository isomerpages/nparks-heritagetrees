<p>The Terap is a tall tree that can grow up to 45 m to 65 m in height in its native forest habitat in Singapore, Myanmar, Thailand, Sumatra, Peninsular Malaysia, Borneo, Java, Philippines and Lesser Sunda Islands where it is common.</p>
  
<p>Its trunk often displays great buttresses, particularly when the tree is mature. Its leaves and twigs have hairy surfaces. The leaves of a young tree are deeply lobed, but as the tree matures, it produces leaves that are more entire (non-lobed), stiff and leathery. The male flowers occur in spike-like heads that are furrowed and ridged, turn from yellow to brown, and hang from stalks that are about 6 cm long. In contrast, the female flower heads are upright and barrel-shaped with soft, hairy, curved spines. Male and female flowers are found on the same tree (monoecious). Its fruit is about 18 cm long, and turns from cream-yellow to brown and emits a nauseous, rancid smell when ripe.</p>
  
<p>Various parts of the Terap have ethnobotanical value, such as for food, medicine and building materials. The latex of the tree, known as&nbsp;<em>gutta terap</em>, is used as a gum (bird lime) to trap birds.</p>
