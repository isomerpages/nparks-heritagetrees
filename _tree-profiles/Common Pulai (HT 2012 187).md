<p>The Common Pulai or&nbsp;<em>Alstonia angustiloba</em>&nbsp;is a mid-canopy tree that can reach up to 40 m in height. It is native to Singapore and is naturally distributed across the primary or secondary forests and swamp forests of Sumatra, Peninsular Malaysia, Borneo and Java.</p>

<p>It has buttress roots and its deeply fluted, dark grey trunk supports a pagoda-shaped crown. The Common Pulai has simple, glossy, dark green leaves that are oval shaped, arranged in whorls. The tree exudes latex when any part of the plant is damaged. In Singapore, flowering can be triggered by distinctly cool dry weather, and the tree produces many sprays of creamy-white flowers accompanied by a heady fragrance reminiscent of burnt sugar.</p>

<p>The Common Pulai and Indian Pulai (<a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/flora/2/7/2705"><em>Alstonia scholaris</em></a>) are both similar looking and commonly planted in Singaporeâ€™s urban landscapes. However, they can be differentiated by a few characteristics: The Indian Pulai has greenish-yellow flowers while the Common Pulai has creamy-white flowers, and the Indian Pulai has a stipule at the base of the petiole (leaf stalk) while the Common Pulai does not.</p>
