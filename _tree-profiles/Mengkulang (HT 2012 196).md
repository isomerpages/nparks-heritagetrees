<p>This species was described as new to science in 1908 from material obtained from this Tree. Henry Ridley, the first Director of the Gardens, had this to say when he described the species: <em> "There are two or three of these fine trees in the Gardens' Jungle. The finest is a conspicuous object by the plant sheds."</em> Besides being probably older than the Gardens and the first plant of its kind known to science, the Tree itself has a unique growth habit. The entire trunk of the Tree is made up of vertically folded plates, which are a unique feature of this species.</p>
