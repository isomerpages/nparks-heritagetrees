<p>The Sea Teak is an evergreen conifer native to Singapore. This attractive coastal tree can reach heights of 20 m. The crown is dense, broadly conical to irregular or dome-like, often with long, horizontally straggling branches that curve up at the ends. The leaves are dark green, tough and leathery. They are narrow, linear and taper to a point at the apex.&nbsp;Leaves on juvenile trees tend to be larger and longer than those on mature individuals.</p>

<p>This species has male and female cones on separate trees (dioecious). A tree would bear either male cones or female cones. Female cones consist of a single seed seated on a fleshy receptacle (seed stalk) that birds feed on.</p>

<p>While the species is locally endangered in the wild, it is popularly planted as landscape trees.</p>

<p>This Sea Teak is located next to The Beaulieu House, which was built in the 1910s as a seaside home. This tree may well have existed here before or when the Beaulieu house was built and likely before the Sembawang Naval Base construction began in 1923.</p>

<p>As a slow growing species with a girth of 2.2 m, this Heritage Tree was estimated to be around 100 years of age when it was endorsed as a Heritage Tree in 2017. female flowers are found on the same tree (monoecious). Its fruit is about 18 cm long, and turns from cream-yellow to brown and emits a nauseous, rancid smell when ripe.</p>
