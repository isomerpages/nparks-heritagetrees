<p>The Medang is a common and fast growing tree, native to secondary forests of Singapore. The mature tree is fairly easy to identify from the bark which is covered in small lenticles giving it a unique "bubbly" texture. <em>L. elliptica</em> has a monopodal habit that is most evident in younger trees, and not as obvious for mature trees.</p>
  
<p>Flowering occurs along the branches and behind the leaves and may easily go unnoticed by the casual observer. The first indication of flowering is the appearance of the yellow fluffy flowers on the forest floor. Once the flowers are observed on the ground, observation through binoculars into the crown will reveal a spectacular flash of yellow along the branches.</p>

<p>For more information on the species, please refer to NParks' Flora &amp; Fauna Web profile <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/flora/5/6/5625">here</a>.</p>
