<p>The Keruing Kerut is an endangered native to Singapore and typically found in lowland rainforests. It is a tall emergent tree that reaches up to 70 m in height. Its leathery leaf is&nbsp;plicate (almost like being folded)&nbsp;with a tapering tip and&nbsp;8 – 12 pairs of lateral veins that are prominent on the underside. Petiole is 1.5 – 3 cm long and knee-like (geniculate). Leaf buds and stipules are very hairy on the outer surface but smooth on the inner surface.</p>

<p>Its pale yellow flowers have dark pink striations in the centre. Flowering only once every few years in an event known as “masting”, the Keruing Kerut overwhelms seed predators with an abundance of seeds to ensure the survival of a new generation.</p>

<p>This individual is believed to be part of the original rainforest inhabitants of the Changi area.&nbsp;This Heritage Tree had a girth of 3.2m when measured in Year 2003.</p>
