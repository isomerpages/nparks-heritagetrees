<p>Seeds collected by EJH Corner from the eastern coast of Malaya.</p>
  
<p>Corner wrote in the 3rd edition of his book, Wayside Trees of Malaya (1988), "In parts of the East Coast States, the kapur formed almost pure forests, and it was at once distinguished by its beautiful, open, fine-leafed crown. It was one of the tallest trees in the Indo-Malayan tropics, frequently attaining more than 200 feet(60m) in height". Kapur-forests have been logged so extensively that they are hardly to be seen. This species produces an aromatic resin which can be found all over the tree. To smell the resin, you can crush the fallen leaves at the tree base. The wood of the Kapur can be used in general construction such as flooring and decking.</p>
