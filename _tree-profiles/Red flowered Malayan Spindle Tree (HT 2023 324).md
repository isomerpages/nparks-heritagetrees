<p>An evergreen tree that grows up to 40 m in height. Crown is dark green and heavy, supported by wide-spreading limbs. Bark is light brownish grey, somewhat cracked and fissured. Leaves are large, about 17cm by 2.5cm in size, oblong, thinly leathery, 10-14 pairs of side veins with very fine crowded parallel veinlets between them. Flowers occur in slender unbranched spikes, are small about 0.5cm across, red in colour, faintly fragrant. Fruit is about 4cm long, conical, olive yellow in colour, one brown seed covered in orange pulp.</p>
  
<p>According to EJH Corner, in his book "Wayside Trees of Malaya", he observed that the pale giant squirrel (<a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/2/3/233"><em>Ratufa affinis</em></a>) would eat the fruits of this species of tree. Interestingly, and sadly at the same time, the pale giant squirrel was once readily found in our forests but now it is estimated that there are not more than 10 individuals left in our forests.</p>
