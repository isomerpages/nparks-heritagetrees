<p>A deciduous tree that grows up to 20m in height. Crown is open and spreading. Bark is pinkish-grey. Leaves are compound, bipinnate. Flowers occur in dense spike-like clusters, light creamy-yellow to orange in colour, star-shaped with 5 tiny petals. Fruits are narrow, curved pods that ripen from green to dark brown.</p>
  
<p>Its small creamy yellow, inconspicuous star-shaped flowers give way to dark brown fruits pods, which then twist and open to expel small, hard scarlet seeds. The seeds are very attractive and are eagerly gathered by children to play with and for playing games. The earliest recorded Herbarium specimen taken from this tree was dated in 1900, so this tree would well be over 100 years old.</p>
