<p>The Petai is a tall evergreen tree that grows up to 15 - 45 m in height and can be found in Southeast Asia, ranging from southern Thailand through Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore, Sumatra, and Borneo. It has a smooth trunk with large butrresses supporting an umbrella-shaped crown. The compound leaves are feather-like with small narrow leaflets and its creamy-white flowers are closely set on a round head with a long stalk (about 20 - 50 cm long), which develop into moderately long fruit pods.</p>
  
<p>The edible seeds are often used as vegetable in Southeast Asian cooking, either eaten raw, cooked or roasted as a side-dish with rice. The seeds emit a garlicky scent and flavour and may be considered foul by some people, hence its English common name, Stink Bean. The timber from this tree is used plywood, temporary light construction, interior finishes and carpentry, as well as wood for furniture, crates, clogs, matches and disposable chopsticks.</p>

<p>The tree stands near the Keramat or shrine of Sultan Iskandar Shah, the fifth and last king to rule Singapore in the 14<sup>th</sup> century. The shelter has twenty wooden pillars holding up the roof, carved in a fighting cock motif of Javanese origin.</p>
