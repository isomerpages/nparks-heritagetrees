<p>A bushy evergreen tree that can grow up to 35 m in height. Crown is rounded. Bark is greyish-brown and rough. Leaves are oblong elliptic, tipped, thinly leathery and drooping, rather yellowish green (young leaves are pinkish brown). Flowers occur in hanging green spikes or catkins (8 - 20cm long). Fruits are round (1cm wide), enclosed at the base of the flower. </p>
  
<p>The leaves can be recognised as they are very unequal-sided at the base with the broadest side foremost. The species was previously known as <em>Streblus elongata</em>, where the generic epithet <i>Streblus</i>means 'crooked' in Greek.</p>
