<p><em>Adenanthera malayana</em> subsp. <em>malayana</em>&nbsp;is an&nbsp;endangered tree in Singapore. It can reach up to 45 m and have bipinnate leaves. The fruit pod twists into a spiral and splits open when ripe. Each fruit contains about 10 red and black ornamental glossy seeds.</p>

<p>The species has a dark green, heavy crown supported by wide-spreading limbs. Its bark is light brownish grey and lightly cracked and fissured. The leaves are large, oblong, thinly leathery, and have 10-14 pairs of side veins with very fine crowded parallel veinlets between them.</p>

<p>It produces small, faintly fragrant, red flowers measuring about 0.5 cm across in slender unbranched spikes. Its egg-shaped, olive-yellow coloured fruit is about 4 cm long and contains one brown seed covered in a bright orange aril. This aril is eaten by birds and small mammals like squirrels.  </p>

<p>This Heritage tree had a girth of 3.1 m when it was endorsed in 2023.</p>
