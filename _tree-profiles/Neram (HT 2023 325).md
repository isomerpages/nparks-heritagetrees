<p>The Neram or Keruing Neram is a large tree that can grow up to 30 m in height. Its trunk is often twisted with flaky, reddish-brown bark, and its leaves are often oblong in shape, thus the specific epithet <em>oblongifolius</em> ("oblong-leaved"). Its genus <em>Dipterocarpus</em> is derived from Ancient Greek, meaning "two-winged fruit."</p>

<p>Native to Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, and Borneo, the Neram can be found growing closely to one another along riverbanks, often leaning with their canopy hanging above the water. The winged fruits are dispersed by both wind and water, where the seeds will germinate at the river edge.</p>

<p>The name Keruing also refers to the timber from <em>Dipterocarpus</em> species, and is often used for flooring, buidling support, paneling, boxes and crates. The timber for Neram is used for large padi-husking tables in their native origins.</p>

<p>Neram Road and Neram Crescent, both located in Yio Chu Kang district, are named after this common name of this species.</p>
