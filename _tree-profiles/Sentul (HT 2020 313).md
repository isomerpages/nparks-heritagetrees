<p>The Sentul is a large, evergreen tree, usually with smooth grey bark with the trunk that is generally un-buttressed. It may grow up to 50 m tall, supported by high buttressed roots, which may be up to 3 m tall in old trees. Young branches and the underside of leaves are thickly covered in short, brown hairs. These leaves are usually dark green in colour but become bright red before dying.</p>

<p>The Sentul is cultivated in Southeast Asia for its fruit, which are round and yellow or brownish in colour, measuring about 5-8 cm across. These fruits are produced prolifically after flowering that occurs typically about once a year. The fruit contains a white, juicy pulp (aril) surrounding the seeds. The aril tastes either sour or sweet. Each fruit contains 3 - 5 brown, ovate to ellipsoid seeds.</p>

<p>Clemenceau Avenue was named after Georges Clemenceau, premier of France who visited Singapore from 17 to 22 October 1920. This Heritage Sentul had a girth of 3.3 m when it was endorsed in 2020.</p>
