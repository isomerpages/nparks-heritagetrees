<p>This is a tall evergreen tree that can grow up to 25 m to 40 m in height. Its trunk is massive and cylindrical from the base. Its bark is smooth, pinkish-brown in colour, often cracking at the branch-trunk junction. It has compound leaves, with leaflets that are oblong elliptic, dark green, leathery, about 10 x 2cm in size, and dotted with minute oil glands. The flowers are about 3cm wide and smell of sour milk. Pods are heavy and woody and stink when bruised.</p>
  
<p>The West Indian Locust Tree originated from the tropical American jungles and was introduced to Singapore in 1875. A quick-growing evergreen tree, it can be recognised by the twin leaflets (compound leaves) and the woody fruit pods. The tree produces a strong timber and yields a resin used to manufacture a quality varnish called copal.</p>
