<p>The Angsana is a large deciduous tree that grows up to 40 m in height.
Its crown is dense, dome-shaped, wide-spreading, with drooping, pinnate
compound leaves. Its flowers are yellow and occur in large bunches of 15-30
cm long, and the fruits are flattened, disc-like pods with papery wings
about 5 cm in diameter, 1 or more seeds in each. Cultivated as a street
tree in Singapore, the Angsana is native to India, China throughout Southeast
Asia, excluding Singapore.</p>
<p>The right stimulus triggers the development of floral buds high up on
the crown of the Angsana, unnoticed by anyone, until it simultaneously
bursts into bloom. This brilliant display of colour lasts only for a day,
after which the tree lays a soft carpet of yellow flowers on the ground
beneath it.</p>
<p>This Heritage Tree has the largest girth for an Angsana in the Register.
The tree is believed to be planted in the 1880s by the British when the
artillery battalion was stationed on Pulau Blakang Mati, Sentosa’s old
name.</p>
