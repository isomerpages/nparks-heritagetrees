<p>The Damar Hitam Gajah is a large emergent tree with greyish-brown bole and large and sharp buttresses. The bark is closely fissured when young, becoming scaly when older. It has white flowers with a tinge of pink, about 1 cm wide. The fruits are winged. The three outer wings (~ 1 cm) are slightly hairy. <em>Richetia gibbosa</em> was formerly known as <em>Shorea gibbosa</em>, and is the only local species in the damar hitam group of Shorea (now collectively grouped under the genus <em>Richetia</em>), named for the black <em>dammar</em> (resin) they produce.
  
</p><p>This Tree is probably one of the last few of this species standing in Singapore. It produces commercially valuable timber and is popular with loggers because it is relatively free from defects and works well and cleanly with power and hand tools. This Heritage Tree was seen flowering in August 2013. However, no fruit setting was observed later.</p>
