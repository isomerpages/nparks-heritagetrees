<p>The Kapok is a fast-growing, deciduous tree that can reach up to 70 m in height. The trunks of younger trees are covered in sharp, conical prickles but will gradually become thorn-less as it matures. In matured specimens, the tree is often heavily buttressed. The branches are arranged in a tiered fashion, resembling a pagoda. It sheds its digitately-compound leaves before flowering and fruiting in response to drought although in cultivation, the tree might still flowers with a full canopy of leaves. The cream-coloured flowers are nocturnal and milky scented, attracting pollinating bats. The fruits are large, hanging pods that split when ripe to release white fibre to which tiny black seeds are attached. The fibre is buoyant and water-resistant and was used in the past to stuff life-jackets, pillows and mattresses.</p>
  
<p>The Kapok originated from tropical America and is the National Tree of Puerto Rico. </p>

<p>This Heritage Tree was planted around 1970 when the Toa Payoh satellite town and the flyover were built. It now stands as a living landmark for commuters. It had a girth of 5.5 m when measured in Year 2001.</p>
