<p>The Burmese Banyan is a rare strangler fig species that is distributed in scattered locations of India, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and China. It can reach up to 30 m in height and a wide, spreading crown. It produces numerous aerial roots that eventually develop into pillar roots. Ripe figs are dark cherry red, purple or near black in colour. However, fruits from this species usually develop without seeds; this could be due to it not being on its native land and the absence of its associated fig wasp.</p> 
  
<p>Thought to be as old as Singapore Botanic Gardens, this Heritage Tree was depicted in old paintings of the Gardens. Some of the Gardens Herbarium staff had mentioned that they used to play around this Heritage Tree when they were children in the 1930s.</p>
