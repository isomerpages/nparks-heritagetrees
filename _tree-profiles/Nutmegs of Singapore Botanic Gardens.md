<p>The Nutmeg is a medium tree that reach up to 10 metres, producing a pyramid-shaped crown. The dark green leaves are fragrant when crushed. The tree produces yellow, bell-shaped flowers, and ovoid fruits with a fleshy husk that splits to reveal the seed kernel (nutmeg) and the aromatic red lace-like aril (mace).</p>

<p>A native of the Moluccas, the Nutmeg was a major spice crop in Singapore in the 1840s before disease wiped out the local plantations in the 1860s. The area around present-day Orchard Road used to be occupied by nutmeg, pepper and fruit orchards, which gave rise to the roadâ€™s name.</p>

<p>As <em>Myristica fragrans</em> are dioecious (male and female flowers are borne on different trees), these Heritage Trees are identified as female trees for they have been observed fruiting. These trees are one of the few remaining crop trees in the former Economic Garden, which started in 1879 for the research and experimentation of economic plants.</p>
