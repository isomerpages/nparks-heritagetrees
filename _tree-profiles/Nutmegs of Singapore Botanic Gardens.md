<p>This is an evergreen monopodial tree, with the sexes separated on different trees (dioecious).</p>

<p>A native of the Moluccas, the Nutmeg tree is the source of the nutmeg spice. Nutmeg was a major spice crop in Singapore in the 1840s before disease destroyed plantations in the 1860s. In the 1800s, the area around present-day Orchard Road was occupied by nutmeg, pepper and fruit orchards, which gave rise to the roadâ€™s name.</p>

<p>This Heritage Trees are female trees as they were observed to have fruited. The flowers are pollinated by beetles.</p>
