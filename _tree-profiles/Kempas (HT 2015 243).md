<p>An endangered species, resident of lowland freshwater peat-swamp forests and native to Singapore, the Kempas is a lofty emergent tree that bears leathery pinnate leaves. Its leaflets vary between being egg-shaped to lance-shaped. &nbsp;Its straight cylindrical trunk can grow up to 60 m tall, with the branches occurring at the top of the tree, and its wood is highly sought after for timber. This giant also develops huge thick plank buttresses up to 6 m in height, much taller than any man!</p>

<p>When this tree begins to bloom, its crown becomes densely covered in white flowers. Its fruit is a flat and thin oblong pod about 3â€“4.5 cm wide by 9.5â€“15 cm long and contains a flat seed.</p>

<p>The genus <em>Koompassia</em> is a Latinised derivation of <em>Kempas</em>, the Malay name of this species. The specific epithet <em>malaccensis</em> is Latin for 'Malacca', referring to one locality in the natural distribution of this species.</p>

<p>This Heritage Tree is one of the biggest specimens in the Singapore Botanic Gardens, and can also be viewed up-close by the public. This Heritage Tree is dedicated to Mingxin Foundation, for their generous contributions to NParks' registered charity and Institution of a Public Character (IPC), the Garden City Fund. </p>
