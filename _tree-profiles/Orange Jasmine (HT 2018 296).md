<p>The Orange Jasmine is native to Southern and Southeast Asia, Northern Australia and New Caledonia. A compact evergreen shrub that typically grows to 2.5 to 3.5 m tall, it can occasionally become a tree reaching up to about 12 m in height, as this remarkable specimen highlights.</p>

<p>The Orange Jasmine has a dense growth form and blooms year-round, making it an excellent hedge plant for screening. Its compound leaves are alternate and pinnate, with three to seven dark green and glossy leaflets. Its small and white flowers are produced in abundance and have a very pleasant fragrance.</p>

<p>Birds like the Yellow-vented Bulbul (<a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/7/6/763"><em>Pycnonotus goiavier</em></a>), Black-naped Oriole (<a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/4/5/458"><em>Oriolus chinensis</em></a>), and Coppersmith Barbet (<a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/3/5/35"><em>Megalaima haemacephala</em></a>) are attracted by the fleshy and bright red fruit and help to disperse the seeds after feeding on the fruit.</p>

<p>This tree was likely planted after the Fairy Point Chalets were built in the late 1920s as residences for senior British officers. It had a girth of 2.6 m and was thought to have stood here for more than 70 years when it was endorsed as a Heritage Tree in 2018.</p>
