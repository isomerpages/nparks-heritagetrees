<p>The Ordeal Tree originates from tropical Africa and can grow to a height of 20 m to 30 m. It has a wide-spreading crown and its young leaves are attractive with their coppery&nbsp;colour. Its flowers are small, cream to yellow, and grow in dense, long bunches. When pollinated, they mature into flat, woody pods.</p>

<p>The bark contains an alkaloid that acts on the heart, and some African tribes make a poison from it that is applied to arrows. The bark can be pounded into a powder that, if placed in water, will turn the water red. This is sometimes dispensed as an â€˜ordealâ€™ poison to people accused of crimes. The belief is that the person will die from the concoction if they are guilty, and survive if innocent.</p>

<p>This Ordeal Tree originally stood in the former Economic Garden but was transplanted to its current location before 1920. This was done in preparation for the Economic Gardenâ€™s land to be reallocated for the development of Raffles College.</p>

<p>This Ordeal Tree is more than 100 years old and had a girth of 5.4 m when endorsed as a Heritage Tree in 2019.</p>
