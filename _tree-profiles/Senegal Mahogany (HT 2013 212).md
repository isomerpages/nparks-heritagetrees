<p>The Senegal Mahogany is a fast-growing tree native from Tropical West Africa to Uganda. It is a fast growing tree. It is naturally found in riverine forests and savannah woodlands but has become relatively scarce due to heavy exploitation.</p>
  
<p>This Heritage Tree was planted by the former Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew on 2 Nov 1980. In the 1980s, the Senegal Mahogany was commonly used for road-side planting in Singapore due to its rapid growth, ease of transplanting, and ability to tolerate the harsh &amp; dry urban environment.</p>
