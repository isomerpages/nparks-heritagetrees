<p>The Hazel Sterculia is a large deciduous tree that can reach heights of up to 40 m. Its natural distribution is from India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh to Southeast Asia. It grows on coastal areas and in semi-open forests, and has a straight bole with a smooth grey to whitish outer bark and fibrous inner bark.</p>
  
<p>The tree is dioecious, meaning that male and female flowers are borne on separate trees.&nbsp;Its flowers lack petals, although they have a red, five-lobed calyx that resembles a set of petals. They give off an unpleasant smell, and the treeâ€™s scientific name hints at this â€“ the genus <em>Sterculia</em> was named after the Roman god of manure, Sterculius or Sterquilinus, and its species epithet, <em>foetida</em>, means â€˜foul-smellingâ€™. Its fruit is bright red and has one to five boat-like sections that house 10 to 12 black seeds&nbsp;in total.</p>
