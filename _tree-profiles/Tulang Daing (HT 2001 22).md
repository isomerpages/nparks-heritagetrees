<p>A handsome, evergreen tree that can grow up to 30m height. Dense, dome-like crown. Dark glossy leaves give it a dark appearance. Flowers are reddish purple. Pods are hard, brown, leathery, thick and flat, around 10x 6cm in size, with 1-2 seeds in a pod. Native to this region. </p>
  
<p>This Heritage Tree is more than 100 years of age. As reported in the second part of I H Burkill's History of SBG published in the Gardens Bulletin, 1918-21, Lawn F was planted with Leguminous trees in 1889. The earliest recorded Herbarium specimen taken from this Tree was dated in 1929. It was keenly observed recently that this specimen has pneumatophore roots in keeping with a preference for a swamp habitat, rather like the <em>Alstonia pneumatophora</em> Heritage Tree on the other side of Swan Lake. These roots are obvious adaptations to its location in a former swamp forest here at the Singapore Botanic Gardens.</p>

<p>This species was previously known by its synonym, <em>Callerya atropurpurea</em>.</p>
