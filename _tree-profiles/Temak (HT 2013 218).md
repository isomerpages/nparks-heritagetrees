<p>The Temak is a large semi-deciduous tree with thick, fissured bark and a dense crown of oblong to elliptical leaves. The pinwheel-shaped flowers are about 2.5 cm across, white with a red-tinge in the centre. They develop into winged nuts with three outer wings growing up to 9 cm long and two smaller inner wings up to 4.5 cm long.</p>

<p>This species was introduced to Singapore, where its native range extends from India through continental Southeast Asia to the northern Peninsular Malaysia. It was thought that this Heritage Tree was probably planted in the late 1960s - early 1970s, possibly being one of the Dipterocarp trees that was planted along the Main Gate Road by Mr Wong Yew Kwan, the first Commissioner of Parks and Recreations.</p>
  
<p>Dipterocarp trees, like the Temak, exhibit a masting behaviour where the same species flower and fruit simmultaneously. This Heritage Tree was observed to flower and set fruit three times previously within 1983-1986 and three more times recently in 2012-2014.</p>
