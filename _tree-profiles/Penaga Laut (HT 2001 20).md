<p>The Penaga Laut is a slow-growing, evergreen tree that can reach 30 m in height. This species is native to Singapore and is endangered in the wild locally.</p>

<p>A wide-spreading crown supported by a short, thick trunk with dark brown bark that is deeply cracked (fissured) is a characteristic of Penaga Laut. The scientific name <em>Calophyllum</em> means "beautiful leaf" in Greek and aptly describes the attractive dark green, glossy, and leathery leaves. Lined with numerous slender parallel veins, this feature is distinctive of the&nbsp;<em>Calophyllum</em> genus. During flowering, clusters of white blooms emit a sweet fragrance, which helps to attract pollinating insects like bees. Its ball-shaped fruit measures 2-5 cm in diameter and is light green in colour.</p>
  
<p>Penaga Laut is exceptional as all parts of the tree – the leaves, bark, flowers, fruit, seeds, wood, root – can be used. For example, the fragrant oil pressed from the seeds is valued for use in cosmetics and soap-making, and has medicinal qualities. The resin, leaves and roots also have medicinal uses while the heavy, reddish wood can be used in heavy construction, boat building and for furniture.</p>

<p>This Penaga Laut is more than 100 years old and the Botany Centre was designed and built around it in order to preserve it. This Heritage Tree had a girth of 6.8m in Year 2001 and 6.9m in 2014.</p>
