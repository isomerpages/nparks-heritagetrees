<p>Go on a journey back in time as you cruise the historical Lim Chu Kang
Road. Drive along this tranquil outback as you take in the old kampong
ambience and lush greenery of Angsana, Broad Leaf Mahogany and Rubber trees,
as well as the thick shrubbery of Simpoh Ayer and Common Sendudok, that
line its rural roads.</p>
<p>Built before the 1900s to serve the gambier, pepper and rubber plantations
dotting the north-western countryside, the road became the main connection
between the villages and the city-bound roads of Choa Chu Kang and Bukit
Timah as the population grew. The stretches at Ama Keng and Thong Hoe Village
were once lined with single and two-storey residences and shop houses.
These shops provided for the everyday needs of the rural community. The
old attap and zinc-roofed homes that were scattered along this beautiful
road were sheltered by the same mature trees that are still standing today.</p>
