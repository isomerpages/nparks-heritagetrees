<p>Enjoy a slow relaxing drive as you navigate through the meandering and
serene Mount Pleasant Road flanked by mature Saga trees. Take a trip down
memory lane and experience the old world charm of period black-and-white
bungalows fronted by wild sown trees such as cinnamon, palms and figs.</p>
<p>The elegant pre-war homes in this area were built to house families of
Police Force officers during Singapore’s colonial era. An early resident,
Mr G. H. Brown owned the estate in the 1860s and lived in a residence that
shared the same name as the hill it was sited on – Mount Pleasant (Source:
Makepeace et al, 1921*). Part of the property had been called Bukit Brown,
possibly after Mr Brown, and cemetery grounds now cover the hilly slopes
along Lornie Road.</p>
